# Dark Mode Toggle (Windows tray tool)
I was a perpetual dark mode user for over a decade. Then in my pursuit for the most eye-safe workspaces (soft contrast, low font hinting etc) I discovered that light mode is actually optimal in higher ambient light situations. My workflow then changed to using light theme throughout the day. Then dark theme just in the evening, or if I have the blinds drawn.

Windows lets you toggle dark mode, but only inside a settings menu. Which is a bit annoying. And there weren't actually any existing apps in the store to allow you to simply toggle dark mode with a click. So I built one.

## How to use
1. Install the app from the Microsoft Store.
2. Go find the icon in your notification area / system tray.
3. Click the icon, then click toggle dark mode.

## Startup
This is set to load on system startup.

## Uninstall
Go to Add/Remove Programs, search "Dark Mode Toggle" then uninstall.

## Permissions
As changing dark mode requires changing a registry entry, Dark Mode Toggle needs fairly high permissions. I couldn't see a way around this unfortunately. However I thought by sharing the source here it should give some assurance that nothing untoward is happening. Also due to this permission request, Microsoft give it an extra verification before listing a version in the store.
